# Genomics-and-High-Dimensional-Data
In this project, we will analyze a single-cell RNA-seq dataset, with the goal of unveiling hierarchical structure and discovering important genes. The datasets provided are all different subsets of a larger single-cell RNA-seq dataset, compiled by the Allen Institute.
